**1: Data analysis**

The script can be run without modification, the printouts will be on the shell. 

The python file must be put in the same folder as the csv files that were provided, or it is possible to change the value of the variable rep (at the begining of the python file) by indicating the path to the folder where the csv files are located.

There are some comments and indications on the work done on the data in the comments script. 

**2: SQL Challenges**

The datasets have been named donneesApp for "references initialized in shop.csv" and donneesExtraites for "retailer extract.csv". For the columns, all the spaces in the names have been removed in the data base I used for the query. I didn't find the same number of product in the shop but not on the application, I don't know why. I used a SQLite online compiler to run my query.
